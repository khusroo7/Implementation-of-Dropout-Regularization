1. Introduction: The notebook demonstrates the use of dropout regularization in a neural network on the Sonar dataset for binary classification (Rocks vs Mines).
2. Data Preprocessing:One-hot encoding for the target variable ('R' → 1, 'M' → 0). Train-test split with train_test_split.
<br>
3. Neural Network Models:
<br>
Two models:
<br>
Without dropout.
<br>
With dropout (50% neurons dropped after each hidden layer).
<br>
Both models are trained using binary_crossentropy loss and adam optimizer.
4. Results: Dropout regularization improved test accuracy from 0.73 to 0.78, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing overfitting.
